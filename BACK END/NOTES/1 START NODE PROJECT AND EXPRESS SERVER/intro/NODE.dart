/**
 * NODE
 ========
 Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment 
 that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server-side. It is 
 designed to build scalable network applications and is known for its 
 event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it well-suited for real-time applications.

Key features of Node.js include:

JavaScript on the Server-Side: Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript
 not only on the client side (in web browsers) but also on the server side.
  This enables full-stack development using a single programming language.

Event-Driven and Asynchronous: Node.js uses an event-driven architecture 
that is based on the JavaScript event loop. It employs non-blocking I/O 
operations, allowing multiple operations to be performed concurrently 
without waiting for each to complete before moving on to the next.

V8 JavaScript Engine: Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript runtime engine,
 which is the same engine used by the Google Chrome browser. V8 compiles 
 JavaScript into machine code, resulting in fast execution.

NPM (Node Package Manager): NPM is the default package manager for Node.js.
 It is a vast ecosystem of open-source libraries and tools that developers
  can easily use in their Node.js projects.

Scalability: Node.js is designed to be scalable and can handle a large number
 of concurrent connections with low overhead. This makes it suitable for building 
 real-time applications, such as chat applications, online gaming, and streaming services.

Community and Ecosystem: Node.js has a large and active community of developers. 
The NPM registry hosts a vast number of libraries and frameworks, making it easy
 for developers to find and use pre-built solutions in their projects.

Cross-Platform: Node.js is cross-platform, which means it can run on various 
operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Node.js is commonly used for building various types of web applications, 
server-side APIs, microservices, and other networked software. Popular 
frameworks built on top of Node.js include Express.js for web applications
 and Koa.js for building web servers.
