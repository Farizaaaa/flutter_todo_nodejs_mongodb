/**
 * MONGODB
===========
MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database management system that is designed 
to handle large volumes of data in a flexible and scalable way. It is classified as
 a document-oriented database, which means it stores data in a format similar to JSON 
 (JavaScript Object Notation). MongoDB is part of the NoSQL family of databases, and 
 its architecture allows for the storage and retrieval of data that can be semi-structured 
 or even unstructured.

Key features of MongoDB include:

Document-Oriented: MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents called BSON 
(Binary JSON). These documents can have varying structures, making it easy to represent complex data.

NoSQL Database: MongoDB is a NoSQL database, which means it does not rely on a traditional
 relational database management system (RDBMS) structure. It provides more flexibility in 
 handling diverse data types and evolving schemas.

Dynamic Schema: MongoDB does not enforce a fixed schema for the data, allowing developers to 
add fields to documents without affecting the existing data.

Scalability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally by adding more servers to a distributed 
system. This makes it suitable for handling large amounts of data and high traffic loads.

Query Language: MongoDB uses a rich query language that supports a wide range of queries, including 
field, range, and regular expression searches.

Indexing: Like traditional databases, MongoDB supports indexing to improve query performance.

Aggregation Framework: MongoDB includes a powerful aggregation framework that allows for complex 
data processing and analysis.

Geospatial Indexing: MongoDB supports geospatial indexing and queries, making it suitable for 
applications that involve location-based data.

Community and Ecosystem: MongoDB has a large and active community of developers. Additionally, 
there are various drivers and libraries available for integrating MongoDB with different programming languages.

Atlas Cloud Service: MongoDB offers a cloud-based service called MongoDB Atlas, which provides
 managed MongoDB instances with features such as automated backups, scaling, and security.

MongoDB is commonly used in a variety of applications, including content management systems, 
real-time analytics, mobile app development, and e-commerce platforms. It has gained popularity
 due to its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use for developers working with large and dynamic datasets.
